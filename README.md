# hello-world

hey guys

My birth name is Jonathan but I love to climb, hence the nickname monkeynathan, monkey-jonathan minus the jo.
I have always wanted to code and program and things like that. This so far is the best chance I have found.
I am now 13 and hoping to have a lot of fun here at git.

This is jonathan here signing out.
          Over and out
